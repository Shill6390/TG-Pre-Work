<!-- HTML (Hypertest Markup Language) provides structure and presentation of raw text to the content appearing on a website. HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as hyperlinks. The above text is a h1 heading. By carefully marking up the contents of a page, developers can create a hierarchy of information which serves several purposes:

it allows users scanning a site to quickly pick out the most important ideas.
it helps visually impaired users navigate the content of a page using special software.
it helps search engines pick out important keywords that might otherwise get lost in a sea of text.

the browser uses this information not only for rendering purposes but also so that it can create a structure which other programs (screen readers for example) can interpret.-->

<!-- the <video> tag requires a src attribute with a link to the video source and it requires an opening and closing tag. After the src attribute, the width and height attributes are used to set the size of the video displayed in the browser. The controls attribute instructs the browser to include basic video controls: pause, play and skip. The text, "Video not supported", will only be displayed if the browser is unable to load the video.

We cannot use the alt attribute within the opening video tag. If the video doesnâ€™t load we might want to display a link to another video that does. As attributes can not contain markup, this scenario would not be possible with alt attributes alone. -->
